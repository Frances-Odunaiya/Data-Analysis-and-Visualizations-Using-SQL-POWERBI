## Features
- Data Extraction with SQL: Utilize SQL queries to extract data from the pizza sales database.
- Data Cleansing and Transformation: Clean and transform the extracted data to prepare it for analysis.
- Descriptive Analytics: Perform descriptive analysis using SQL to calculate key metrics such as total sales, average order value, top-selling pizza flavors, etc.
- Visualization with Power BI: Create visually appealing and interactive dashboards in Power BI to represent the analyzed data.
- Time Series Analysis: Analyze sales trends over time to identify patterns and seasonality.
- Dynamic Filters and Interactivity: Implement dynamic filters and interactive elements in the Power BI dashboard for user exploration.

## Tools and Technologies
- Azure Data Studio: For querying and managing the pizza sales database.
- Power BI Desktop: To create interactive dashboards and reports.
- SQL: Used for data extraction, transformation, and analysis.
- Power Query (M Language): For data cleansing and transformation within Power BI.
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Used for creating calculated columns and measures in Power BI.

## Project Workflow
- Data Extraction: Write SQL queries to extract relevant data from the pizza sales database.
- Data Cleansing and Transformation: Clean and transform the extracted data using SQL queries or Power Query in Power BI.
- Visualization Development: Create visualizations in Power BI using various chart types (e.g., bar charts, line charts) to represent the analyzed data.
- Dashboard Design: Design an interactive dashboard layout in Power BI, incorporating the created visualizations and enabling interactivity.
- Dynamic Filters and Interactivity: Implement dynamic filters, slicers, and drill-down functionalities to enhance user interactivity.
- Time Series Analysis: Add time series charts to the dashboard to visualize sales distribution and trends.
- Documentation and Presentation: Document the analysis process, dashboard functionalities, and insights derived from the data. Prepare a presentation to share the findings with stakeholders.

## Key Findings
