# Pizza Sales Dashboard Project with SQL and Power BI

## Introduction
The Pizza Sales Dashboard Project aims to analyze pizza sales data using SQL queries and visualize the insights through an interactive dashboard created with Power BI. By combining SQL for data analysis and Power BI for visualization, this project provides a comprehensive solution for understanding and presenting pizza sales trends, customer preferences, and revenue metrics.

## Features
- Data Extraction with SQL: Utilize SQL queries to extract data from the pizza sales database.
- Data Cleansing and Transformation: Clean and transform the extracted data to prepare it for analysis.
- Descriptive Analytics: Perform descriptive analysis using SQL to calculate key metrics such as total sales, average order value, top-selling pizza flavors, etc.
- Visualization with Power BI: Create visually appealing and interactive dashboards in Power BI to represent the analyzed data.
- Geospatial Analysis: Incorporate geographical analysis into the dashboard to visualize sales distribution by location.
- Time Series Analysis: Analyze sales trends over time to identify patterns and seasonality.
- Customer Segmentation (Optional): Segment customers based on their ordering behavior and preferences.
- Dynamic Filters and Interactivity: Implement dynamic filters and interactive elements in the Power BI dashboard for user exploration.

## Tools and Technologies
- SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS): For querying and managing the pizza sales database.
- Power BI Desktop: To create interactive dashboards and reports.
- SQL: Used for data extraction, transformation, and analysis.
- Power Query (M Language): For data cleansing and transformation within Power BI.
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Used for creating calculated columns and measures in Power BI.

## Project Workflow
- Data Extraction: Write SQL queries to extract relevant data from the pizza sales database.
- Data Cleansing and Transformation: Clean and transform the extracted data using SQL queries or Power Query in Power BI.
- Visualization Development: Create visualizations in Power BI using various chart types (e.g., bar charts, line charts) to represent the analyzed data.
- Dashboard Design: Design an interactive dashboard layout in Power BI, incorporating the created visualizations and enabling interactivity.
- Dynamic Filters and Interactivity: Implement dynamic filters, slicers, and drill-down functionalities to enhance user interactivity.
- Time Series Analysis: Add time series charts to the dashboard to visualize sales distribution and trends.
- Documentation and Presentation: Document the analysis process, dashboard functionalities, and insights derived from the data. Prepare a presentation to share the findings with stakeholders.
