# Pizza Sales Dashboard Project with SQL and Power BI

## INTRODUCTION
The Pizza Sales Dashboard Project aims to analyze pizza sales data using SQL queries and visualize the insights through an interactive dashboard created with Power BI. By combining SQL for data analysis and Power BI for visualization, this project provides a comprehensive solution for understanding and presenting pizza sales trends, customer preferences, and revenue metrics.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

**KPI's REQUIREMENT**

We need to analyze key indicators for our pizza sales data to gain insights into our business performance. Specifically, we want to calculate the following metrics:
1. Total Revenue: The sum of the total price of all pizza orders.
2. Average Order Value: The average amount spent per order, calculated by dividing the total revenue by the total number of orders.
3. Total Pizzas Sold: The sum of the quantities of all pizzas sold.
4. Total Orders: The total number of orders placed.
5. Average Pizzas Per Order: The average number of pizzas sold per order, calculated by dividina the total number of pizzas sold by the total number of orders.
   
**CHARTS REQUIREMENT**

4. Percentage of Sales by Pizza Size: This chart will help us understand customer preferences for pizza sizes and their impact on sales.
5. Total Pizzas Sold by Pizza Category: This chart will allow us to compare the sales performance of different pizza categories.
6.Top 5 Best Sellers by Revenue, Total Quantity and Total Orders: This chart will help us identity the most popular pizza options.
7. Bottom 5 Best Sellers by Revenue, Total Quantity and Total Orders: This chart will enable us to identify underperforming or less popular pizza options.

## FEATURES

- Data Extraction with SQL: Utilize SQL queries to extract data from the pizza sales database.
- Data Cleansing and Transformation: Clean and transform the extracted data to prepare it for analysis.
- Descriptive Analytics: Perform descriptive analysis using SQL to calculate key metrics such as total sales, average order value, top-selling pizza flavors, etc.
- Visualization with Power BI: Create visually appealing and interactive dashboards in Power BI to represent the analyzed data.
- Time Series Analysis: Analyze sales trends over time to identify patterns and seasonality.
- Dynamic Filters and Interactivity: Implement dynamic filters and interactive elements in the Power BI dashboard for user exploration.

## TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES

- Azure Data Studio: For querying and managing the pizza sales database.
- Power BI Desktop: To create interactive dashboards and reports.
- SQL: Used for data extraction, transformation, and analysis.
- Power Query (M Language): For data cleansing and transformation within Power BI.

## PROJECT WORKFLOW

- Data Extraction: Write SQL queries to extract relevant data from the pizza sales database.
- Data Cleansing and Transformation: Clean and transform the extracted data using SQL queries or Power Query in Power BI.
- Visualization Development: Create visualizations in Power BI using various chart types (e.g., bar charts, line charts) to represent the analyzed data.
- Dashboard Design: Design an interactive dashboard layout in Power BI, incorporating the created visualizations and enabling interactivity.
- Dynamic Filters and Interactivity: Implement dynamic filters, slicers, and drill-down functionalities to enhance user interactivity.
- Time Series Analysis: Add time series charts to the dashboard to visualize sales distribution and trends.
- Documentation and Presentation: Document the analysis process, dashboard functionalities, and insights derived from the data. Prepare a presentation to share the findings with stakeholders.

## KEY FINDINGS

- **Key Performance Indicators**: Looking at the Total Revenue, Avg Order Value, Total Pizzas sold, Total Orders, and Avg Pizzas per Order provides us with valuable insights into the performance of various KPIs, enabling data-driven decision-making and strategic planning.
